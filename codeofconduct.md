# Neuronal Code of Conduct ðŸ§ ðŸ“ˆ

## Our Pledge

We, the members, contributors, and leaders of **Neuronal**, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences**
- **Gracefully accepting constructive criticism**
- **Focusing on what is best for the community**
- **Showing empathy towards other community members**

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- **The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances**
- **Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks**
- **Public or private harassment**
- **Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission**
- **Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting**

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these rules when enforcing the Code of Conduct:

1. **Be fair and impartial**: Leaders should treat all cases consistently, without bias.
2. **Assume good intent**: Approach all reports with the assumption that the reporter did not intend to cause harm.
3. **Make it easy to report**: Provide multiple ways for community members to report unacceptable behavior.
4. **Protect privacy**: Respect the privacy of those involved in any report or investigation.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing Neuronal in public spaces. Examples of representing Neuronal include using an official Neuronal e-mail address, posting via an official Neuronal social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, please notify a community leader as soon as possible. You can contact us at:

- **Email**: [devaansh.neuronal@gmail.com](mailto:devaansh.neuronal@gmail.com)

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. **All community members are expected to adhere to these guidelines at all times**. Violations may result in temporary or permanent bans from community spaces and activities.
